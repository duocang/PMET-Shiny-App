Arabidopsis is a member of the mustard (Brassicaceae) family, which includes cultivated species such as cabbage and radish. Arabidopsis is not of major agronomic significance, but its small genome size and ease of cultivation offer important advantages for basic research in genetics and molecular biology. Arabidopsis thaliana has a genome size of ~135 Mb, and a haploid chromosome number of five.",

M. truncatula is a close relative of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a widely cultivated crop with limited genomics tools and complex autotetraploid genetics. As such, the M. truncatula genome sequence provides significant opportunities to expand alfalfa's genomic toolbox. The complete reference sequence displayed here is the 4.0 assembly update published in 2014. The nuclear genome has eight chromosomes.",

The ancestral progenitor genomes are considered to be Triticum urartu (the A-genome donor) and an unknown grass thought to be related to Aegilops speltoides (the B-genome donor).
